## Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the number of wins a national football team is expected to achieve during a FIFA World Cup tournament. The approach leverages bivariate regression, a type of linear regression that analyzes the relationship between two independent variables and a dependent variable.

The model uses **goal difference** and **goals scored per match** as the two independent variables to predict the **number of wins**. These metrics provide a quantitative way to evaluate a team's performance and likelihood of winning matches based on historical data.

The notebook walks through the entire data analysis and modeling process:
- Data collection and preprocessing to ensure a clean and usable dataset.
- Visualization of historical match data to identify trends and relationships.
- Development and training of a regression model using the Scikit-learn library.
- Model evaluation to assess prediction accuracy and performance.

This project is intended to provide a better understanding of predictive modeling in the context of sports analytics and can be a valuable tool for analyzing team performance in international football tournaments.
